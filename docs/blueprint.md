# **App Name**: Neon Surf

## Core Features:

- Multi-Platform Search: Search for videos and GIFs across multiple adult content platforms including Pornhub, XVideos, XHamster, YouPorn, Sex.com, and RedTube using web scraping.
- AI-Powered Selector Suggestion Tool: If a search fails for a particular platform because the site structure has changed, the tool will attempt to generate updated CSS selectors for that site, displayed in the settings for easy copy and paste.
- Video/GIF display: Display results in a clean grid. For videos, include duration overlays; allow animated previews on hover.
- Modal View: Enables users to play videos, and/or view GIFs in an overlaid modal, and navigate to its source page in a new tab.
- URL-based history: Implement back/forward navigation via url state management
- Favorites System: Let users save their favorite finds in a dedicated tab. The AI tool remembers video/GIF cards and the display type (video/gif), even across sessions.
- Configuration options: Add support for API URL and scraping definitions changes using tool, enabling configuration without code changes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid violet (#BE52F2) to evoke a sense of modernity and allure, without resorting to cliches.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated violet (#21152E) to provide contrast and make content pop.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#6353F2) as a complementary shade to guide user interactions and add subtle visual interest.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, neutral, and highly readable user interface. Use different weights and sizes to establish hierarchy.
- Minimalist icons, primarily using a single stroke weight, should represent primary actions like favoriting. Use color to signal state change.
- Cards will feature high-quality thumbnails that fade to the video preview, set on a dark backdrop. Information density should be balanced.
- Subtle transitions should be added to provide feedback. Use a light touch; ensure these do not detract from the utility of the application.
